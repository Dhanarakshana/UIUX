#DESCRIPTION OF TASK 
Objective:
To redesign the landing page of eBay.com with a focus on enhancing both usability and visual appeal, making the interface cleaner, more modern, and user-friendly.

Tasks Performed:
Analysis of Current Design:

Reviewed the existing eBay homepage.

Identified usability pain points such as cluttered layout, inconsistent spacing, and overwhelming information density.

Took note of key features that needed to be retained (search bar, categories, deals, etc.).

Wireframing and Layout Planning:

Created low-fidelity wireframes to establish a cleaner structure.

Focused on better visual hierarchy, simplified navigation, and clear call-to-action areas.

UI Redesign:

Designed a new visual style using a modern, minimalistic aesthetic.

Used consistent spacing, intuitive icons, and more whitespace for a clean look.

Redesigned the header with a fixed search bar, clear sign-in/cart buttons, and a dropdown for categories.

Improved the product highlights section with larger images, simplified text, and a focus on current deals.

Final Touches:

Refined typography and color palette for accessibility and consistency.

Ensured the layout is responsive and mobile-friendly.
